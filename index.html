<h1> Can we change our relationship responses? <h1>

<h3>Yes.</h3> <p>Change is possible. As a result of creating the conditions for change and developing an attitude of looking at situations differently, you can enhance your approaches to relationships for more positive outcomes. This helps you to re-energise, re-vitalise and empower yourself in your personal and professional relationships.

The old adage, &#8217;if you want different results, you have to try different things&#8217; certainly applies here. The Red Squirrel is about facilitating such change...<h4>Dare to be different!  </h4>    </p>
